## About the organisers

The conference director of PyCon UK 2022 is **Ann Barr**.

The conference is staged by the **PyCon UK Society Limited** (a company registered in England and Wales <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10073469">no.&nbsp;10073469</a>) on behalf of the **UK&nbsp;Python Association** (a charity registered in England and Wales <a href="http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1173471&SubsidiaryNumber=0">no.&nbsp;1173471</a>).

## PyCon UK artwork

PyCon UK is very grateful for the original and characteristic graphic art produced for us -- as it has been for several years -- by [The Developer Society](https://www.dev.ngo). This includes our website, our logos and designs, and the instantly-recognisable Pythons that grace them.
