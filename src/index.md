  <h3>COVID-19 policy</h3>
  <p>After two years without a PyCon UK, our priority is to hold a safe event.</p>
  <p>We expect attendees to be mindful of health and considerate to others during the event. This includes having up-to-date vaccinations, taking a self-administered test in case of symptoms, and observing all reasonable precautions.</p>
  <p>Although there are currently no legal requirements to wear face-masks at events such conferences, <strong>we strongly recommend (and politely request) that all our attendees wear masks whenever possible</strong>, and particularly when moving around the building.</p>
  <p>We will offer full refunds to attendees who are unable to attend the conference.</p>
