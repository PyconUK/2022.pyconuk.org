  <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>Session chairs have an extremely valuable role in the smooth running of a conference. You manage a room for a given run of talks and are responsible for the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Helping the speakers feel comfortable and sure of themselves.</li>
    <li>Acting as a conduit between the speaker and the audience, helping the audience get the most value from the sessions.</li>
    <li>Making sure that the session, and therefore the conference, runs on times.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Checklist</h3>
  <p>To help the sessions run smoothly, we've put together a small checklist of things you should do as a session chair. Read over them, and note them down somewhere: they'll help you make PyCon UK 2022 a fantastic conference!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Arrive to your session early! It's important that sessions start on time, and they can only do that if the chair is present!</li>
    <li>
      <p>Before each talk in your session begins, introduce yourself to the speaker. You need to find out some information from them:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>How should you pronounce their name? It's embarrassing to pronounce a speaker's name incorrectly. Confirm with the speaker how they'd like their name pronounced!</p></li>
        <li><p>Check whether the speaker wants questions during their talk, after the talk, or not at all.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>Inform the speaker of how much time they will have to <em>speak</em>, taking the questions into account. In a 30 minute slot, there are 25 minutes of content and 5 minutes of switchover time.</p>
          <p>Note that, if the speaker wants to take questions at the end, they'll usually want 5 minutes for questions. This means that a speaker will <em>speak</em> for 20 minutes in a 30 minute slot.</p>
          <p>It's extremely important that speakers keep to their time slot, and making sure they know how much time is available to them before they start helps.</p>
        </li>
      </ol><br />
    </li>
    <li>At the start of the slot, introduce the speaker to the audience. Tell the audience whether there will be questions, and if they can ask them during the talk or not.</li>
    <li>
      <p>Count the speaker down for their speaking time: Give them 5 and 1 minute warnings, and then flag them when their speaking time is over.</p>
      <p>Don't <em>stop</em> a speaker until they're at the session time limit (25 minues). If a speaker is speaking past their time limit, you <em>must</em> stop them. Give them 20 seconds to wrap up, but the 5 minute handover period <em>must</em> be respected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When the speaker has finished, you're in charge of running the questions (if there are any):</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Before beginning, tell the audience that you'll only accept <em>actual</em> questions. Statements and advertisements for personal projects should be done after the session.</p></li>
        <li><p>When questions are asked, ensure that the audience can hear them: repeat them if needed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make sure questions are appropriate. If they aren't, feel free to use your authority to take another question.</p></li>
        <li><p>If no-one else is prepared to ask the first question, you should!</p></li>
      </ol><br />
    </li>
    <li>When there's only 5 minutes left in the session, call it to a close. Thank the speaker!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This seems like a lot, but it's mostly fairly simple. Keep track of your responsibilities, and everything will go smoothly. Enjoy your sessions!</p>
