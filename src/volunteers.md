<p>A big thank you to all of the volunteers who helped prepare and organise the conference, and to those who helped on the day!</p>

<p>If you're hoping to volunteer to help out during the conference you can specify that when you order your ticket and/or ask one of the volunteers on the day how you can help.</p>

<p>If you think you should be on this list, but aren't, please let us know what name you prefer to be on the list as. Likewise, if you are on here but no longer wish to be, let us know. We don't have a "real names" policy, but try to keep it polite!</p>
